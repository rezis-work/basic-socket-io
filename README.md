# Socket.io Demo Project

Welcome to the Socket.io demonstration project for Lineacademy's Backend Development Course!

This repository showcases real-time bidirectional communication using Socket.io with Node.js. Socket.io enables event-based communication between clients (browsers) and servers, making it perfect for building interactive applications like:

- Chat applications
- Live notifications
- Collaborative tools
- Real-time dashboards
- Multiplayer games

## Key Features Demonstrated:

- Establishing WebSocket connections
- Basic event emission and listening
- Server-client communication
- Connection management

To get started:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Start the server with `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser

Check the browser console and server logs to observe the real-time connection events!
